This is a «personal» website of Martin Zemlicka (with diacritics: Žemlička),
meaning that the intention is to mainly be a dumping ground for things done by
its creator.


### Syntactical Conventions

Although contradictions are not avoided, I do actually try to be consistent
with my own idiosyncratic ways of using various typographic and syntactical
conventions.

* **« and »** are used in instances where, would one be speaking, one would do
  some sort of air quotes or slight somewhat-irono-sarcastic emphasis on a
  word.
* **“ and ”** are used for quoting shorter passages of whose source is not the
  text that is being read; that is: external sources.
* **‘ and ’** are used for quoting strings from within the text. A device for
  showing that the string surrounded by ‘ and ’ is a direct reference to a
  previous usage of the string; that is: internal sources.
* ***italics*** are used for normal (as opposed to ‘air quote’) emphasis.
* **Footnotes**[^1] are used for either citing references, or, more commonly,
  for meta comments from the author or other most-likely-snarky remarks.
